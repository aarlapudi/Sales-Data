## Data Cleaning and Standardization Project
## Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a customer order dataset to prepare it for further analytics and reporting.
The work was carried out using a combination of Python (Pandas) for automation and Excel for manual validation and corrections.

 ## Tools & Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Pandas (for data cleaning and transformation)

Jupyter Notebook (for automation)

Microsoft Excel (for manual review, corrections, and validation)

Git & GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

## Data Cleaning & Transformation Steps
## Python-Based Cleaning
# 1️ Phone Number Normalization

Removed unwanted characters (spaces, dashes, parentheses) using str.replace().

Standardized phone numbers by:

Trimming or padding numbers to match country-specific lengths

Adding country codes based on COUNTRY column

Converting to international format: +<CountryCode><Number>

Converted phone numbers to string type to avoid Excel’s automatic number formatting (scientific notation).

# 2️ Postal Code Fixes

Identified and filled missing postal codes for cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles using a mapping dictionary.

Ensured all postal codes were stored as strings to preserve leading zeros.

## Excel-Based Cleaning

For all other columns, manual review and cleaning were done directly in Excel:

STATE Column → Filled 2500 missing values using city-to-state mapping.

CITY, STATE, COUNTRY → Standardized naming (title case) and removed trailing/leading spaces.

PRODUCT-RELATED COLUMNS (PRODUCTLINE, PRODUCTCODE, MSRP) → Checked for inconsistencies and corrected them.

ORDERDATE Column → Verified date format consistency.

Duplicate Rows → Identified and removed duplicates where necessary.

Other Null Values → Filled missing values appropriately or left them blank if no reliable source existed.

## Final Verification

Validated results using Excel filters, pivot tables, and summary checks.

Exported cleaned dataset as updated_dataset.xlsx to preserve formatting.
